## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy a module into your project
cp -r registry/auth/src/go/* yourproject/internal/auth/

# Adapt the configuration
# Edit config.go: set JWT secret, database URL, etc.

# Implement the store interface
# type UserStore interface { ... }

# Wire up routes
# See registry/auth/examples/gin/main.go
```

## Why Copy-Paste?

Backend modules share 80% of their skeleton across projects. Instead of installing a framework, copy pre-built, production-ready modules and own every line of code.

- **Code ownership** — every line is yours after copying
- **Explicit dependencies** — standard library by default; security exceptions are declared
- **Security-first** — input validation, rate limiting, injection prevention built in
- **AI-friendly** — `__llms__.md` files let AI assistants understand modules quickly
